def: "Multicystic dysplasia of the kidney is characterized by multiple cysts of varying size in the kidney and the absence of a normal pelvicaliceal system. The condition is associated with ureteral or ureteropelvic atresia, and the affected kidney is nonfunctional." [https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0736-9199]
comment: Multicystic kidney dysplasia is the result of abnormal fetal renal development in which the affected kidney is replaced by multiple cysts and has little or no residual function. The vast majority of multicystic kidneys are unilateral. Multicystic kidney can be diagnosed on prenatal ultrasound.

def: "The pattern in which a particular genetic trait or disorder is passed from one generation to the next." [https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0736-9199]
comment: While there is a close conceptual relationship between allelic requirement and inheritance, they serve different purposes; allelic requirement is necessary for variant annotation pipelines and to determine if a given variant in a specific context is relevant to the phenotype of the patient e.g. a heterozygous variant (in the absence of compound heterozygosity) is relevant for dominant but not for recessive disease; while inheritance is used for describing the mode of inheritance of a phenotype and is particularly applicable in the clinical setting for communicating recurrence risk, to guide family screening, and to guide reproductive advice.

def: "A mode of inheritance that is observed for traits related to a gene encoded on one of the autosomes (i.e., the human chromosomes 1-22) in which a trait manifests in heterozygotes. In the context of medical genetics, an autosomal dominant disorder is caused when a single copy of the mutant allele is present. Males and females are affected equally, and can both transmit the disorder with a risk of 50% for each child of inheriting the mutant allele." [https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0736-9199]
